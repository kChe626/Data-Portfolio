Hi there, and thanks for visiting! This repository showcases my technical capabilities in SQL and data visualization through a collection of projects, case studies, and course exercises. You'll find examples ranging from complex SQL queries (featuring joins, CTEs, and optimization techniques) to interactive Tableau dashboards designed to transform raw data into actionable insights.

Below you'll find highlighted projects demonstrating my ability to:

üîç Clean, analyze, and query datasets using SQL

üìä Create clear, impactful visualizations in Tableau

üéØ Solve business problems through data-driven approaches

Whether you're reviewing this for potential collaboration or exploring my work, feel free to dive into the code, examine the dashboards, or reach out with questions/feedback. Let's connect and talk data!
