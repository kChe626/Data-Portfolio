### Hello! I’m Kevin — Data-Focused and Results-Driven

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a data enthusiast with practical experience in **SQL**, **Python**, and data visualization tools like **Tableau** and **Power BI**, focused on solving real business problems through clean data, clear insights, and actionable results.

In this portfolio, you'll find examples of my work in:

-  **SQL** – Writing complex queries, optimizing performance, and working with relational databases to extract meaningful insights.  
-  **Python** – Data cleaning, analysis, and automation using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.  
-  **Data Visualization** – Creating intuitive dashboards and reports to help stakeholders make informed decisions quickly.

My goal is to bridge the gap between data and decision-making. I’m comfortable owning a project from data wrangling to final presentation, and I enjoy turning ambiguity into clarity through thoughtful analysis.

Thanks for stopping by — I’d love to connect and discuss how I can add value to your team!

## [Project 1: Global Employment Layoffs (SQL)](https://github.com/kChe626/Layoffs_Data_Cleaning)

This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a dataset tracking global workforce layoffs using MySQL. The process involves handling missing values, normalizing data formats, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency for better analysis.

## [Project 2: US Car Sales Data Cleaning & Analysis (SQL & Tableau)](https://github.com/kChe626/Car_Sales)

This project involves cleaning and standardizing a dataset of US car sales obtained from Kaggle. Using MySQL, I processed the data to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure uniform formatting. After cleaning the dataset, I conducted an in-depth analysis to answer key questions, such as total car sales, regional variations, manufacturer performance, model preferences, and demographic insights. This analysis helps uncover trends and patterns, providing valuable data-driven insights into the automotive market. This project also visualize US car sales data using Tableau. The dataset was analyzed to highlight regional variations in car sales, manufacturer performance, model preferences, and demographic trends. The interactive dashboard provides clear insights through dynamic charts and filters, allowing users to explore key automotive market trends efficiently.

## [Project 3: British Airways Dashboard (Tableau)](https://github.com/kChe626/Airways-Visulazation-Dashboard-Tableau)

This interactive Tableau dashboard analyzes British Airways passenger reviews, highlighting ratings for food, entertainment, service, and comfort. Users can filter by traveler type, seat class, aircraft, and region to explore trends and insights, helping evaluate airline performance and customer satisfaction.

## [Project 4: Walmart Sales Data Cleaning & Analysis Project (Python, SQL & Power BI)](https://github.com/kChe626/Walmart)

This project integrates Python and SQL to clean, transform, and analyze Walmart sales data. It begins by detecting file encoding and cleaning the dataset—removing duplicates, handling missing values, and adding features such as total transaction value. The cleaned data is then exported and loaded into a MySQL database, where SQL queries address key business questions, from analyzing payment methods and branch performance to evaluating year-over-year revenue trends.
