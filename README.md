Hi there, and thanks for visiting! This repository showcases my technical capabilities in SQL and data visualization through a collection of projects, case studies, and course exercises. You'll find examples ranging from complex SQL queries (featuring joins, CTEs, and optimization techniques) to interactive Tableau dashboards designed to transform raw data into actionable insights.

Below you'll find highlighted projects demonstrating my ability to:

üîç Clean, analyze, and query datasets using SQL

üìä Create clear, impactful visualizations in Tableau

üéØ Solve business problems through data-driven approaches

Whether you're reviewing this for potential collaboration or exploring my work, feel free to dive into the code, examine the dashboards, or reach out with questions/feedback. Let's connect and talk data!

## [Project 1: Global Employment Layoffs](https://github.com/kChe626/Layoffs_Data_Cleaning)

This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a dataset tracking global workforce layoffs using MySQL. The process involves handling missing values, normalizing data formats, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency for better analysis.

## [Project 2: US Car Sales Data Cleaning & Analysis](https://github.com/kChe626/Car_Sales)

This project involves cleaning and standardizing a dataset of US car sales obtained from Kaggle. Using MySQL, I processed the data to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure uniform formatting. After cleaning the dataset, I conducted an in-depth analysis to answer key questions, such as total car sales, regional variations, manufacturer performance, model preferences, and demographic insights. This analysis helps uncover trends and patterns, providing valuable data-driven insights into the automotive market.

## [Project 3: US Car Sales Dashboard (Tableau)](https://github.com/kChe626/US-Car-Sales-Dashboard-Tableau)

This project focuses on visualizing US car sales data using Tableau. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was analyzed to highlight regional variations in car sales, manufacturer performance, model preferences, and demographic trends. The interactive dashboard provides clear insights through dynamic charts and filters, allowing users to explore key automotive market trends efficiently.

## [Project 4: British Airways Dashboard (Tableau)](https://github.com/kChe626/Airways-Visulazation-Dashboard-Tableau)

This interactive Tableau dashboard analyzes British Airways passenger reviews, highlighting ratings for food, entertainment, service, and comfort. Users can filter by traveler type, seat class, aircraft, and region to explore trends and insights, helping evaluate airline performance and customer satisfaction.

## [Project 5: Walmart Sales Data Cleaning & Analysis Project (Python & SQL)](https://github.com/kChe626/Walmart)

This project integrates Python and SQL to clean, transform, and analyze Walmart sales data. It begins by detecting file encoding and cleaning the dataset‚Äîremoving duplicates, handling missing values, and adding features such as total transaction value. The cleaned data is then exported and loaded into a MySQL database, where SQL queries address key business questions, from analyzing payment methods and branch performance to evaluating year-over-year revenue trends.
