Hi there, and thanks for visiting! This repository showcases my technical capabilities in SQL and data visualization through a collection of projects, case studies, and course exercises. You'll find examples ranging from complex SQL queries (featuring joins, CTEs, and optimization techniques) to interactive Tableau dashboards designed to transform raw data into actionable insights.

Below you'll find highlighted projects demonstrating my ability to:

üîç Clean, analyze, and query datasets using SQL

üìä Create clear, impactful visualizations in Tableau

üéØ Solve business problems through data-driven approaches

Whether you're reviewing this for potential collaboration or exploring my work, feel free to dive into the code, examine the dashboards, or reach out with questions/feedback. Let's connect and talk data!

## [Project 1: Global Employment Layoffs](https://github.com/kChe626/Layoffs_Data_Cleaning)

This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a dataset tracking global workforce layoffs using MySQL. The process involves handling missing values, normalizing data formats, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency for better analysis.

## [Project 2: Superstore Sales Dashboard with Streamlit](https://github.com/tushar2704/Superstore-Sales-Dashboard-with-Streamlit)

This project involves cleaning and standardizing a dataset of US car sales obtained from Kaggle. Using MySQL, I processed the data to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure uniform formatting. The cleaned dataset was then analyzed to identify regional variations in car sales, assess manufacturer performance, explore model preferences, and uncover demographic insights.

## [Project 3: Car Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/tushar2704/Superstore-Sales-Dashboard-with-Streamlit)

This project focuses on visualizing US car sales data using Tableau. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was analyzed to highlight regional variations in car sales, manufacturer performance, model preferences, and demographic trends. The interactive dashboard provides clear insights through dynamic charts and filters, allowing users to explore key automotive market trends efficiently.
